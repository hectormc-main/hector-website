## Overview
*May 2022 - September 2022*

This is perhaps the period of time in which I had the most personal growth.
I had never really considered myself much of a leader before, content to be the right-hand and have strong opinions.
Now, however, I learned the value in good leadership and just how hard it is.
This was also my first internship into front-end development where I found out I like making things pretty.

The CEO, [Christine Nolan](https://www.linkedin.com/in/nolanchristine/), was amazingly kind and helpful during my time there.
I am immensely grateful to have worked there with her.

## Leadership

This was a very open-ended internship in which the interns were to split into teams and be self-led.
I decided to lead to front-end team as that was a field I wanted to explare more about.

I made it a point to talk to every person in the team individually so I can get their thoughts on direction and my leadership.
I got a lot of valuable feedback during that time.

I constantly reached out to the CEO and/or senior Rails dev for advice and direction, something which was very difficult for me early on.

## Frontend

We were very new to this and 
I remember looking up "how to plan front-end development" a lot.
What I found was not too far from intuition:
1. Wireframe
2. Figma
3. Implement

I then scheduled bi-weekly meetings to discuss our progress, provide feedback, and combine our results.
I think it would be good to show what we accomplished during this time.

### Figma

I can't share too much of our mock-ups because some of them have client information.
However, here is what I can share:
* [Search Page](https://www.figma.com/proto/2AWhDPXRAF4oJSXIvFvE61/Website-Redesign---1?node-id=113%3A397) - Main novelty here is the addition of sidebar with modal search pages.
This was inspired by AirBnb however, we decided to go with collapsable menus instead.
* [Space Dashboard](https://www.figma.com/proto/Wbg7uQF8dJELsiyrQVisc5/Dashboard?node-id=45%3A130&scaling=min-zoom&page-id=0%3A1) - A mock-up created near the end of my internship. Previous version was a 3x3 grid for the services.
I like the space theme and something not shown is that description would show up like a sci-fi log when you mouse over a service.
I am still not a fan of the side panels and would like to revisit it someday.
* Sponsor Page - This has too much sensitive information, but it was the final piece to the website puzzle. Consideration of where to put what data is tricky because there's so much information to include. Difficult balance between aesthetics and readability that I don't think we struck very well (still unimplemented).

### Ruby on Rails

Honestly, a large part of my internship was taken up by trying to learn/install Rails.

Rails, by itself, was fine.
However, trying to understand the existing codebase took *sooooo* much time.
In addition, dependencies made it very hard to get local versions of the site running; it only ever worked for me.

Regardless, I successfully implemented our design into Rails!
It was, and I quote, "amateurish" and needs multiple revisions by the senior dev before it goes into production.
But! I'm still proud of it.
It was hard.
But I did it.

Having now taken [Software Studio](../classes/software_studio.md), I now know I much prefer Vue.js (makes more sense to my modular brain).
And we also have a very nice website [Music Mentors](https://61040-final-project-gqhc-git-main-chanwooy.vercel.app/#/) which came out pretty well thanks, in large part, to this internship.
I took front-end design lead in that class as I was the most comfortable and experienced in HTML/CSS/Javascript.


## Side Project

Aside from the front-end, I only provided minor tweaks to the website.
One such tweak is the addition of auto-correct/fill into the search bar.
Previous version provided no feedback if your spelling was correct.
Especially given how verbose some company names are, it can be hard to find what you are looking for.

On a similar note, also made it so that the search provides similar results.
