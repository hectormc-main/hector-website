## Introduction

I'm going to talk fairly openly about my past and myself.
There's some uncomfortable bits here - namely everything after "MIT - The first time" - but it's here if you want an insight into who I am as a person.

## Hometown

<img align="right" width="400" height="400" src="/assets/img/about/Pasadena_aerial_MS_TT.jpg">

I grew up in Pasadena, Texas - a small town next to Houston, Texas.
Not the most aesthetic city, in fact I don't like going back that much, but it's familiar.

I'm a child of Mexican immigrants.
Apparently, they crossed the border - with Visas - with me in the womb so that I would be born here.
I was born in Houston, Texas but moved to Pasadena when I was about 9.
I didn't think much of it at the time, but I grew up near those refineries you can see in the background.

Pasadena is a very Mexican town.
By my estimation, it feels about 95% Mexican - [census](https://www.census.gov/quickfacts/pasadenacitytexas) says 71.2%.
My grandma recently visited Pasadena; she was upset because it felt like she didn't even leave Mexico.

## Childhood

I grew up fairly poor - technically poverty I think - but I never worried about food.
I think that came at the cost of never seeing my parents.
My mom was always working 1-2 waitressing jobs and my dad did construction from like 5am to 9pm.

I sometimes joke that I raised myself but that's kinda true.
Despite growing up in a spanish household, I learned english first from all my TV time.
I lack many values/biases/cultural-views of my parents as I grew up without them.
I get most of mine from my own philosophical thoughts of how to be a good human and my overactive empathy.
Reinforced by the introduction of the internet when I was 12;
I wanted to learn more about why people feel the way they do about their beliefs.
I credit this with my aggressive open-minded approach.

In general, I try my best to be conscientious of all people around me.
I want to be considerate and kind to all.
Everyone deserves to be heard.
Make sure everyone is happy; that is what makes me happy.

I think I developed this in reaction to being so alone.
Maybe someone would like me enough to be my friend if I was nothing but a net positive for them.

Despite my adaptations, I struggled socially.
Probably because I didn't have much of a personality.
Made few acquaintances here and there but like 0 friends until high school.
There someone invited me to their house - my first time - and actually interact with people outside of school.
It was nice.
I miss those days.

## MIT - The first time
**Content Warning**: there as some heavy thoughts in this section.
{:.note}

I miraculously got into MIT.
I don't know how it happened.
But it did.

I went to MIT hopeful I can become a new person, and.... I was a nervous wreck.

I socialized a bit with my floor, but I could feel social groups forming and me disjoint from all.
More and more I would stick to my room and do whatever I could to stay in.

I did do decently well at school.
I passed all my of my freshmen classes (except one that I neglected).
However, come sophomore year, I was afraid of everything.

The imposter syndrome was suffocating.
I was not worthy of being there.
I was a failure for thinking this way.
I'm a waste of space for taking this opportunity away from someone else.
People don't deserve to look at me; I do nothing but worsen their day.
The world is a better/happier place if no one interacts with me.

I remember being happy I don't believe in the afterlife.
This life is all I have.
Even if it's nothing, it's better than the void.

I didn't go to a single class nor turn in a single assignment.
I was too ashamed to leave my dorm.

Thankfully, someone who was very kind to me - for some reason - told me to go to MIT and ask for a medical leave.
She told me I was suffering from severe social anxiety and depression; MIT medical confirmed and added [agoraphobia](https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/agoraphobia/symptoms-causes/syc-20355987).

I got my leave and had that semester wiped from my record.
I left for Pasadena at the end of November.

That kind person, Lisa, who told me to go to medical.
She took me on a night out the night before I left MIT.
That was a really fun night.
I cherish that day a lot.
A bright spot in a sea of despair.

## Medical Leave

My parents - now mom and stepdad - never really found out too much about why I left.
In fact, it took them a few months to realize I didn't even finish my sophomore fall semester.
They never really questioned me about it, and I never opened up to them either.

I didn't really open up to anyone, actually.
I had no one to open up *to*.
I stayed in my room.
Distracting myself.
Because reality was too harsh to contend with.

I couldn't do that forever.
I remember being told I would be welcomed back if I got some therapy appointments (with MIT insurance).
I also had a debt to MIT as part of my scholarship would be returned to the school.
Thankfully a dean - Miri Skolnik - fought hard so that I would not be liable for the full amount.

I got went to therapy and got a job in retail.
I was happy to have some progress.
I was happy to do some work.

I stopped going to therapy after 4 sessions.
I didn't like the therapist; I didn't feel listened to.
Once I paid off my debt, the reality that I was working in retail instead of MIT crushed my soul.
I hated myself for letting it get to this point.
I was ashamed to be seen by anyone I knew.
They also knew how far I'd fallen.

I quit the job 4 months in - 9 months after my leave (roughly September 2017).

I stayed inside my room.

## Isolation

It's hard to think back on that time.
Remember what you did today.
Yesterday.
Last week.

Wipe it all away.
Imagine sitting in a room for an entire day.
Waiting until you hear no one in the hallway so you can go to the restroom.
Hearing your stepdad complain to your mom that she "should not worry about their finances as her problem was over there";
I know he was gesturing to me.
Filling every waking moment with vapid entertainment so that your *bad thoughts* don't return.

Now it's a day.
Then it's a week.
A month has passed and you didn't even know.
Months don't mean anything anymore.

Day in.
Day out.
Nothing changes but the fear that this is the rest of your life.
A nothingness only to be discarded.

## Improvement

November 2018 I thought, "I'm so tired of living like this".
It's not a new thought. My fears often overwhelmingly overpowered any positive thoughts.

Yet, it the thought stuck.
"Come 2019, I'll reach out to people and get better".

I became proactive for once in my life.
I got a friend to take me running every weekend - I reached peak 255.
I reached out to older friends and *I* asked them to hang out.
My sister - who ran a staffing company - got me a steel pipe job for March.
Once I started, I reached out to a Miri - MIT dean - who helped me leave to talk about next steps.

In May, I applied to University of Houston - Downtown (UHD).
Part of the recovery process is being ok with where I am.
With or without MIT, I will be successful.

That being said, I still tried to come back.
I took counseling in UHD and did very well in my classes.

I applied to return to MIT for the next - spring - semester.
Weighing 186, visiting my family in Mexico for the first time, I got the acceptance letter days after Christmas.

## MIT - Return

A lot of familiar emotions came back when I was at MIT.
Imposter syndrome.
Anxiety.
Fear.

But I was able to fight back this time.
I forced myself out of my room.
I went to class.
I said yes to social situations.
I wanted to be better.

If you've done the math, you know I'm returning to MIT spring of 2020; the semester COVID-19 hit.

I spent 6 weeks in MIT until I had to go back to Texas.
It wasn't as bad though.
I was getting outside and running every day.
I kept on top of my school work.
And I had weekly counseling sessions with Miri and other returning students.

I was happy with where I was.
I was happy with where I was going.

## COVID

I got lucky and someone I knew from MIT wanted to start an 11-person living situation.
I said yes.
We looked for places.
People dropped out.
And eventually found a 5-person place in Somerville, MA.

We stayed there for 2020 Fall and 2021 Spring.
I really cherish those times.
I grew comfortable in that house.
I got close to the people there.
I found my favorite person in that house.

We spent time together.
Went on hikes.
Hosted feeds - dinner parties but more chaotic.
Went on walks.

I saw a lot of improvement during this time as I finally got to interact with people.
I was a bit rough at first.
I accidentally hurt peoples' feelings.
But I got better.
They told me their grievances and I would change.
I followed-up and changed further if anything bothered them.

We're still friends to this day.
I'm grateful for them.
We had a lot of fun.

## MIT - Graduating

After our lease ended, I went back to MIT for the final three semesters: 2021 Fall, 2022 Spring, 2022 Fall.

MIT-wise, I did well.
My grades improved and I had a semi-consistent schedule.
I got out of my comfort zone and made a few friends.

I didn't always work in the healthiest way, but I tried to keep up my mental health the entire time.

Come 2023, I had finished all of my classes for MIT.
It was almost anti-climatic.
February 15th, 2023 I got an e-mail notification that my diploma JSON was ready to download.

That was it.

## After MIT

Now I'm just looking for jobs.
I've found passion in education and social progress.

I like the puzzle that is software and feeling like I'm improving someone's livelihood somewhere in the world.

Now I've written this.
Maybe this is too much.
Maybe some people would be put off by it.

But I am not ashamed of my leave.
I'm here because of it.
I have a Bachelor's from MIT because of it.

This is who I am.

## Closing thoughts

It's so weird writing this out.
I write about spending 2 years in isolation and it just doesn't compute.
How could that be me?
There are few memories because nothing memorable happened.
Sleep. Wake. Eat at night. Repeat.

Yet, here I am.
Am I sad those years happened?
Kind of?
I wish I could transfer 2023 me to 2015 me and start MIT confident.
But it's that time off that allowed me to grow out of the husk of a human I once was.

It didn't have to take 3~ years though.
Maybe I could've found a therapist that I could connect to and shorten it down to 1 or .5 years.

There are some things I want to improve.
I'm still bad at small-talk.
I've still got a bit of a shell to break down until I open up and become comfortable.
My anxiety is higher on some days than I'd like.

But I'm proud that I've come such a long way.
I'm happy that I'm here.
I'm so excited to live a life I once thought forever out of my reach.
