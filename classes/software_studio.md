## Overview

The end goal for the first half of the class is to create our own version of Twitter - called Fritter.
We don't just want a carbon copy; we want to be sensitive to the population and mold the design around their needs.
The emphasis here is on *design*, not *implementation*.

Our first assignment is creating a static website to host our assignments in.
You may visit it [here](https://61040-fa22.github.io/portfolio-hectormc8426/), but it's not very pretty.  Course material, assignments, and guides may be viewed [here](https://61040-fa22.github.io/).


## Research

### [Twitter Analysis and Critique](https://61040-fa22.github.io/assignments/assignment-1)
Click the header for full assignment details.
{:.note}

This goes beyond a simple, "provide a 1-2 page critique of Twitter".
There are multiple axis in which to view the value Twitter provides to the user.

This is Value Sensitive Design ([VSD](http://www.envisioningcards.com/?page_id=2#1)).
In short, we want to consider who is impacted by Twitter's design decisions.
How that impact changes over time.
How different communities are impacted.
And how its impact shifts as its popularity shifts.

In addition, we are two conduct two interviews beyond the MIT community to assess the value they derive from Twitter.
They are **not** brainstorming sessions.
They're personal interviews that considers the interviewee as a person and how their uniqueness emerges into novel interactions.

[Here](https://61040-fa22.github.io/portfolio-hectormc8426/pages/assignments/1/1.html) is my critique and analysis.

## Design

### [Diverge/Brainstorming](https://61040-fa22.github.io/assignments/assignment-2)

It was around this time when the class became a bit more philosophical. We began to wonder "what is a *concept*"?

In short, we decided on this. A concept:
* Addresses a problem
* Has a clear purpose
* Easy to describe actions
* Relies minimally on other concepts to convey.
* Is generic

For example, a concept I really wanted was *Alias*.
An alias is having multiple "accounts* on one "account".
The necessity for a [friendsta](https://www.urbandictionary.com/define.php?term=friendsta) shows how people want to keep parts of their lives separate from others.

You can find my concepts [here](https://61040-fa22.github.io/portfolio-hectormc8426/pages/assignments/2/2.html).

### [Converge](https://61040-fa22.github.io/assignments/assignment-3)
Everything else is much shorter.
{:.note}

Diverge is thinking of every idea that you kinda like. Converge is where we refine the idea by:
* Thinking about its implementation
* Trade-offs about such implementation
* How this concept interacts with other concepts

[Here](https://61040-fa22.github.io/portfolio-hectormc8426/pages/assignments/3/3.html) are my converged concepts.

### [Review and Refinement](https://61040-fa22.github.io/assignments/assignment-4)

I review myself.
I review others.
Others review me.
Make final-ish changes to concepts.

[Here](https://61040-fa22.github.io/portfolio-hectormc8426/pages/assignments/4/4.html) are my reviews and adjustments.

## Implementation

### [Backend](https://61040-fa22.github.io/assignments/assignment-5)

This was a two-week assignment.
One half creating/documenting RESTful APIs, [here](https://github.com/hectormc8426/Fritter/blob/main/ROUTES.md) are mine.
The other half was actually interfacing with it via simple html and deploying to Vercel. MVP can be found [here](https://fritter-lhmxq3yg1-hectormc8426.vercel.app/).

Minor reflection about this process can be found [here](https://61040-fa22.github.io/portfolio-hectormc8426/pages/assignments/5/5.html).

### [Frontend](https://61040-fa22.github.io/assignments/assignment-6)

Actually make it look pretty this time and do it in Vue.js! I got fairly sick during this time, so I don't have anything to show.

However! There's a lot to see in our final project!

## Final Project

### [Inception](https://61040-fa22.github.io/assignments/assignment-p0)

The best way I can describe this project is that we are to become a small start-up.
We are to create an [authentic](https://61040-fa22.github.io/assignments/assignment-p0) app that provides some real value to the world.

We chose to do crowd-sourced music knowledge.
We wanted to prioritize community and interaction, so we add *showcases* so that people may show-off what they learned from a specific lesson.

### [Final Stretch](https://61040-fa22.github.io/2-assignments.html)

After we had a plan, we were to create this app much in the same way we created Fritter.
Our team worked really well together; I'm happy I got to work with them :)

Our project was called [Music Mentors](https://61040-final-project-gqhc-git-main-chanwooy.vercel.app/#/).
