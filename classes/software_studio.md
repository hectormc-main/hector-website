## Overview

The end goal for the first half of the class is to create our own version of Twitter - called Fritter.
We don't just want a carbon copy; we want to be sensitive to the population and mold the design around their needs.
The emphasis here is on *design*, not *implementation*.

Our first assignment is creating a static website to host our assignments in.
You may visit it [here](https://61040-fa22.github.io/portfolio-hectormc8426/), but it's not very pretty.  Course material, assignments, and guides may be viewed [here](https://61040-fa22.github.io/).


## Research

### [Twitter Analysis and Critique](https://61040-fa22.github.io/assignments/assignment-1)

{:.note}

This goes beyond a simple, "provide a 1-2 page critique of Twitter".
There are multiple axis in which to view the value Twitter provides to the user.

This is Value Sensitive Design ([VSD](http://www.envisioningcards.com/?page_id=2#1)).
In short, we want to consider who is impacted by Twitter's design decisions.
How that impact changes over time.
How different communities are impacted.
And how its impact shifts as its popularity shifts.

In addition, we are two conduct two interviews beyond the MIT community to assess the value they derive from Twitter.
They are **not** brainstorming sessions.
They're personal interviews that considers the interviewee as a person and how their uniqueness emerges into novel interactions.

[Here](https://61040-fa22.github.io/portfolio-hectormc8426/pages/assignments/1/1.html) is my critique and analysis.

## Design

### [Diverge/Brainstorming](https://61040-fa22.github.io/assignments/assignment-2)

It was around this time when the class became a bit more philosophical. We began to wonder "what is a *concept*"?

In short, we decided on this. A concept:
* Addresses a problem
* Has a clear purpose
* Easy to describe actions
* Relies minimally on other concepts to convey.
* Is generic

For example, a concept I really wanted was *Alias*.
An alias is having multiple "accounts* on one "account".
The necessity for a [friendsta](https://www.urbandictionary.com/define.php?term=friendsta) shows how people want to keep parts of their lives separate from others.

You can find my concepts [here](https://61040-fa22.github.io/portfolio-hectormc8426/pages/assignments/2/2.html).

### [Converge](https://61040-fa22.github.io/assignments/assignment-3)
Everything else is much shorter.
{:.note}

Diverge is thinking of every idea that you kinda like. Converge is where we refine the idea by:
* Thinking about its implementation
* Trade-offs about such implementation
* How this concept interacts with other concepts

[Here](https://61040-fa22.github.io/portfolio-hectormc8426/pages/assignments/3/3.html) are my converged concepts.

### [Review and Refinement](https://61040-fa22.github.io/portfolio-hectormc8426/pages/assignments/4/4.html)

I review myself.
I review others.
Others review me.
Make final-ish changes to concepts.

[Here](https://61040-fa22.github.io/portfolio-hectormc8426/pages/assignments/4/4.html), you know the drill.

## Implementation
