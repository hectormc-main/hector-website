I want my work at MIT to be more than just a title and a grade.
I want to show what the class covers and all I have accomplished.
Not all my work has been recorded so some pages will just be synopsis of classes.

## Classes
* [Software Studio]{:.heading.flip-title} --- Thoughtful and comprehensive **design**. Intro to Node.js
{:.related-posts.faded}
* [Computer Systems Engineering]{:.heading.flip-title} --- Design/security of large-scale/distributed systems.
{:.related-posts.faded}
* [Software Construction]{:.heading.flip-title} --- Test-first programming and thorough documentation.
{:.related-posts.faded}
* [Computational Structures]{:.heading.flip-title} --- Starting at the transistor, we learn how to create a RISC-V CPU.
{:.related-posts.faded}
* [Introduction to Machine Learning]{:.heading.flip-title} --- Reinforcement Learning, Neural Networks, etc.
{:.related-posts.faded}
* [Design and Analysis of Algorithms]{:.heading.flip-title} --- Dynamic Programming, Algorithms, Game Theory, Complexity, etc.
{:.related-posts.faded}
* [Automata, Computability, and Complexity Theory]{:.heading.flip-title} --- A look into DFAs, CFGs, and Turing Machines to test the limits of computability.
