I want my work at MIT to be more than just a title and a grade.
I want to show what the class covers and the work I suffered through.
Not all my work has been recorded so some pages will just be synopsis of classes.

## Classes
* [Software Studio]{:.heading.flip-title} --- Thoughtful and comprehensive **design**. Intro to Node.js
