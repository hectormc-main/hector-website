I want my work at MIT to be more than just a title and a grade.
I want to show what the class covers and all I have accomplished.
Not all my work has been recorded so some pages will just be synopsis of classes.

{:.related-posts.faded}
* [Computer Systems Engineering]{:.heading.flip-title} --- Design/security of large-scale/distributed systems.
