  about:
    As I've been searching for jobs, I find myself attracted to those that focus on education.
    I think about my future and I see myself helping less fortunate children get the education they *want*.
    I say *want* as I grew up as one of them.
    I always wanted to have a tutor, to go to a summer camp, to learn more than what was provided.
    But I felt it out of our pockets' reach.
    This does not need to be the case and I want nothing more than to lend a helping hand.

    Beyond education, I also share a fondness for psychology, math, and music.
    I have just graduated from MIT with a bachelor's in Computer Science and Engineering.
    I have been dreaming of this day for so long that's it's strange that it has finally come.
    Though it comes with a tinge of sadness that academia is behind me, I look forward towards my first steps into the real world!
